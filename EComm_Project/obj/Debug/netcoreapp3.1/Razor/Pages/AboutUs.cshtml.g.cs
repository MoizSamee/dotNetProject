        <p class=""lead""> <b> Started out of a garage in 2003, the Posh Pauper has grown into an International source of only the highest quality vintage outerwear, shirts, custom fabrics, and 1 of 1 pieces.
    During Pauper's infancy, Damon attended a commerce seminar and met Moiz, where they discussed how to further scale the blooming flower of a business that was forming in front of them.
    Moiz contributed greatly to the backbone of the business, but some of the product sourcing was lacking in consistency, at times there would be weeks of sold out inventory because Pauper failed to get a constant stream of reliable products.
    If the business were to grow, it needed a solid flow of products to ensure buoyancy in the secon");

    Her reliable European connections, combined with Moiz's next level business commerce solutions, and Damon's impeccable brand vision and taste transformed the Posh Pauper from a garage based home business to one of the largest curated secondhand clothing retailers.
